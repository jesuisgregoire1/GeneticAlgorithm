# GeneticAlgorithm
Leveraging the Flappy Bird template as a foundation, a genetic algorithm is implemented to navigate through a maze-like environment. The genetic algorithm evolves a population of individuals, each representing a unique solution or strategy. Through a process of selection, crossover, and mutation, the algorithm refines and improves the solutions over successive generations.

In the context of the maze, the genetic algorithm guides the behavior of the Flappy Bird character, allowing it to navigate through the maze by adapting its movements based on the genetic information encoded in each individual's genome. The algorithm evaluates the fitness of each individual based on their performance in completing the maze and uses this information to drive the evolution of the population towards more optimal solutions.

By iteratively applying the genetic algorithm, the Flappy Bird character evolves and becomes better equipped to tackle the challenges presented by the maze, ultimately aiming to find an optimal path or achieve a specific objective within the maze environment.
